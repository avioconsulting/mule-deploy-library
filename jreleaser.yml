  description: Mule Deploy is a library/CLI/Maven plugin that provides full lifecycle deployment of MuleSoft applications and API's
  longDescription: |
    Mule Deploy is a Java/Groovy based library to handle the deployment and lifecycle management of MuleSoft applications
    and API's.  It provides a CLI and Maven plugin so that it can be called from existing build tools and CI/CD platforms.
    Mule Deploy can deploy applications to CloudHub, CloudHub 2.0, Runtime Fabric and Standalone Mule runtimes.  It can
    also synchronize API specifications to design center, publish specs from design center to Exchange, and deploy API's
    from exchange to API Manager and promote them between environments.  It can also handle policy attachment to those API's.
